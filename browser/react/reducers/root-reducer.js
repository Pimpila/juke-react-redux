import {SET_LYRICS} from '../constants';

const initialState = {text: ''};

    case: SET_LYRICS;
      return Object.assign({}, state, { text: action.lyric})
      break;
    default:
      return state
  }
}

//Two things to note:
//   1. We use Object.assign to maintain immutability.
//      Since our state only has one key on it, it doesn't matter much, but what if we added more?
//   2. If we receive an action that doesn't have a type we recognize, we return the previous state
